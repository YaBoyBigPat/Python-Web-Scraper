# Python-Web-Scraper

Main python code is in the NBAData.ipynb

This is my first python project following the video tutorial, "Web Scraping NBA Stats With Python: Data Project [Part 1 of 3]" on YouTube that attempts to scrape player data, making it readable and usable for analyzation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGQGd-oa0l4&t=704s

I'm very new to GitHub but I'm excited to post a project here. Even though this project was done with me following a YouTube tutorial, I ran into a good number of challenges and had to change a good bit of the code so it could work for me. This project helped me learn a ton of information about using python imports, pandas, and a couple web scraping techniques. I also learned a lot about communication through the command terminal. I plan on modifying it more so that I can make it my "own" project and have it analyze stock market data or consumer data.

Java is the first language I learned and I'm fairly new to python, so I'll be making projects in both to improve my proficiency in both languages.
