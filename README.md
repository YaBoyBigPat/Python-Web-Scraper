# Python-Web-Scraper

The main python code is in the NBAData.ipynb

This is my first python project following the video tutorial, "Web Scraping NBA Stats With Python: Data Project" on YouTube that attempts to scrape player data, clean it, and make it usable for machine learning. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGQGd-oa0l4&t=704s

Hello, I'm excited to post projects here! Even though this project was done with me following a YouTube tutorial, I ran into a good number of challenges and had to make some changes to the code so it could work for me. This project helped me learn about using python imports, pandas, and a couple of web scraping techniques. I also learned a lot about communication through the command terminal. I plan on modifying it more so that it can also be used in Tableau for data analysis, seeing which stat columns work together when trying to improve the model's accuracy.
